# Cartophiles Web App
Enjoy your very own baseball card collection - online!

This app is built with Vue.js and axios. It uses the [SportsDataIO API](https://sportsdata.io/) for up-to-date data regarding active players from all 30 MLB teams. Assets regarding each team are courtesy of [U.S. Team Colors](https://usteamcolors.com/).

**Cartophiles** is still a work in progress! Please feel free to check back to see updates.

Team colors and logos are the property of their respective owners. I am not affiliated with any of the teams or MLB.
